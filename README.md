# hello-world
My first repository
Hi, David here.  I have programmed in many programming languages including T-SQL, HTML, Visual Basic, PHP, ASP, C++, Java, and a few others.  I starting when I was around 12 years old.  Can program in over 8 languages.  Learning GIT HUB and the GIT API.  Hoping to learn how to push data thru webAPIs.
Just added my first repository.
